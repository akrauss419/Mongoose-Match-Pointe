# Match Pointe

Matche Pointe is a web application designed to give recreational tennis players the power to create and join their own local tennis leagues and teams. All a user has to do to enjoy the full functionality of the app is register/login with his/her Google credentials.

When a user creates a league, they choose their corresponding skill level to attract other players who can compete at their level. They can also customize the league's format, or the number of each match type that constitutes each meeting with another team.

Once users select a league to join, they can create or join a team. When creating one, users choose a team name and weekly practice schedule. As the season progresses, they can track their wins and losses by updating them on the app.

There is also a discussion board available exclusively to registered users. The discussions boards are designed to allow players to post and interact about any tennis-related topic, whether it be scheduling interleague practices, asking for tips, exchanging equipment recommendations, or even just chatting about what's happening on the pro tour. Users have the ability to comment on any discussion post and edit or delete their own discussion topics and comments.
